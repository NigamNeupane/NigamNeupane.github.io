what_i_learned: |
  Today, I practiced more with MATLAB software and revised and learned more functions and syntax. I learned to work with while loop, switch statement, MATLAB debugger, plotting, importing and 
  reading data, working with structures and tables. Switch statement is similar to if/else statement but it uses cases as conditions. MATLAB debugger is useful to quickly check if there are any 
  mistakes in the code and how to fix them. Data from datasets can be plotted using MATLAB which makes data analysis easier. Excel files and CVS files can be imported and read in MATLAB using 
  readtable() syntax. Structure is used to assign related data in common variable to make it easier to work with. It's especially useful for vast datasets. Tables are very useful for data analysis. 
  Unlike matrix, tables are easier to understand and work with. Table makes data collection and storing more orgnized. I also made a program to simulate a dice roll game using random integers syntax, 
  randi(). MATLAB is very easy to use and work in because of AI copilot assistance.
  
blockers: |
  Some blockers I faced was with working with plotting data. The plots were displaying in the same graph and I had to redo the code.
  
reflection: |
  Overally, I learned a lot in today's session. I revised things I had already learned as well as learn new functions and syntax for data analysis. Using MATLAB was much easier than using python 
  in Jupyter as the integrated AI copilot in MATLAB was very helpful in detecting and fixing any problems in the code. After this practice, I am confident that I will be able to work on my assigned 
  project soon.

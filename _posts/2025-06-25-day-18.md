what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working in the research paper and applies the algorithms and codes provides in it. I learned new concepts like data balancing and using ensemble weights to get good accuracy in our algorithm. We applied instance hardness threshold (IHT) to balance the data before training our algorithm. We balance the data to reduce biasness in our algorithm and reduce overfitting. We used the algorithms Decision Tree (DT), 
  Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Logistic Regression (LR). We then applied used a method called 
  weighted voting classifier and then ensemble method to combile accuracy of our algorithm to get 100% accuracy for our algorithm.

  The concept and use of weighted voting classifier and ensemble method was a difficult thing for me today as they were new concepts I learned.
  
reflection: |
  I was able to properly follow the instructions from the research paper to apply it in my algorithm to balance my data for more accurate and 
  efficient ML testing and training. The 100% accuracy was very impressive that I achieved by applying the methods that I had learned. I will 
  practice training diffirent algorithm with various data so that I will be able to understand more about the new things I learned today.

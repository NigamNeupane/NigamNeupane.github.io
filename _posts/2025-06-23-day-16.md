what_i_learned: |
  Today, I trained and tested SVM, KNN, Random Forest and Decision tree with both small data and big data. I used the dataset 'diabetic_data.csv' and sliced specific 
  columns to use for the small data training. I used 5 data columns and surprisingly, I got 50% to 55% accuracy on both training and testing accuracy. 
  All the models I tested gave desirable results. For the big data, I used around 40 data columns to test and train my algorithm. It took time to train 
  and test all 4 models. It took time because the dataset size is 100000x80. The accuracy improved slightly to 60% for all 4 models. My models ran on a 
  problem of overfitting, so I couldn't get good accuracy.
  
blockers: |
  The blocker I faced was with training the four models with big data.
  
reflection: |
  It was a valuable experience to work with 4 models at once and practice with both small and big data. I will continue using these models in my future 
  projects. I will fix the overfitting in my models to get even more accurate results.

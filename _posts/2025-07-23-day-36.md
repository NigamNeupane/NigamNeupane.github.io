what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued working on the group project research paper in Overleaf. I helped my team in writing our reports and findings in Overleaf and leared 
  more syntax and features in Overleaf like citing papers and formats for research papers. I also updated my results in bar graph form in the project 
  report file in Overleaf. I am almost done with the personal Overleaf report and only need to do minor adjustments by consulting with my mentors. I also 
  helped recording the 90 second elevator pritch video with my group. It turned out pretty well.
  
blockers: |
  I am not getting better results from my models trained and tested on balanced data with cross-validation.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in getting closer to completing my final project. I have already completed the project report research paper as well as the 
  group video of the elevator pitch. I am also working on the overleaf project given by CEAMLS. Once I am done with the reports and finalize the project,
  I can work with my group on the final presentation.

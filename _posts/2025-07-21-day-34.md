what_i_learned: |
  Today, I began working on the group project research paper in Overleaf. I helped my team in writing our reports and findings in Overleaf and leared 
  more syntax and features in Overleaf like citing papers and formats for research papers. I also updated my results in bar graph form in the project 
  report file in Overleaf. I am almost done with the personal Overleaf report and only need to do minor adjustments by consulting with my mentors.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems while modifying the codes in Overleaf to properly display the author names.
  
reflection: |
  I need to describe my project and the results I got while applying it in the Overleaf page. I have already worked on the project report page so I will 
  be able to complete this research paper quickly. I also need to work with my team to record an Elevator Pitch video so I need to work on the script as 
  well.

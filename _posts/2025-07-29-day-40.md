what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked with my group to design and update the slides for the final presentation. We divided work and started writing about our project, our 
  accomplishments and the challenges we faced. We will work on our demo video soon. I continued updating the project overleaf as well. I included more 
  results and graphs by training and testing the models on balanced data without cross-validation.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems understanding the new codes. Especially the functions defined in its internal codes.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in learning about a new ML model and how to implement it. The codes were very difficult to understand but I was able to 
  integrate it with my data analysis with the help of my mentor. I compared the results and updated them to the group research paper in Overleaf. I will 
  do even more tests with this model to understand its capabiities and limitations.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned to use Tableau to create graphs and plots for data analysis. I also began working with the project data with the various data 
  analysis softwares I learned about for the past 2 weeks. I used MATLAB to read and clean the data for analyzing. The data is about the diabetic 
  medical records of patients. I used some formulas to fill in any missing values in the dataset like age, weight and height. I also used histograms 
  for further data analysis. The data was very big and MATLAB was very helpful in cleaning and analyzing the vast amount of data.
  
blockers: |
  I was not able to find the mid points for the each values of age variable in the data. The data is in interval form and I couldn't manage to 
  calculate it.
  
reflection: |
  Today's session was a bit difficult one. The first part where i learned to use Tableau software was easy but working with data was a difficult 
  task. I was not able to get the required data from the given dataset, so I couldn't continue with the project today. I will need to do more 
  research regarding the problem and ask my mentors to help me with it.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, we participated in CEAMLS cohort connect. We played some games and participated in some challenges during the event. We also discussed about 
  uploading our work and research in overleaf website. We were taught how to write projects in overleaf. In class, I learned to work with LaTex in 
  overleaf. LaTex is a powerful web-based software to write and use complex mathematical formulas. It is also used to write documents using various 
  syntax. LaTex looks similar to a HTML file but it's purpose and syntax is very different. This software will be very useful to write and apply the 
  required formulas in our research.

  No blockers.
  
reflection: |
  Todays session was quite entertaining, especially in the cohort connect session. We also discussed about field trips to places like NASA, amusement 
  parks, etc. in future sessions. The new software LaTex was also very fun to use because of it's unique features and applications.

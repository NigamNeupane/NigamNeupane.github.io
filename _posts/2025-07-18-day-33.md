what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued updating my findings from machine learning in Overleaf. I updated the table containing the results like accuracy, MAE, MSE, RMSE, 
  % diff in RMSE and time. I also included histograms and barcharts of the finddings in Overleaf. I explained the tables and histograms in paragraphs 
  and made it like a research paper. I also did some work in MATLAB by applying the ML codes.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems with applying the ML codes with unbalanced dataset with cross-validation.
  
reflection: |
  I have completed the majority of work with coding and updating my results in the project report. I need to include some more graphs and charts in the 
  report and also explain them for it to be more like a research paper. I will be able to work with the more advanced version of the custom ELM starting 
  next week.

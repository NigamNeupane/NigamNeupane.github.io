what_i_learned: |
  Today, I applied a new version of the custom ELM. It is more advanced than the older model and can work with even wider range of medical data. This 
  model is capable of achieving higher accuracy with fewer errors. I tested it with other ML models and it performed very well even where other models 
  were struggling. I need to do more tests with this model and update the results in Overleaf.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems understanding the new codes. Especially the functions defined in its internal codes.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in learning about a new ML model and how to implement it. The codes were very difficult to understand but I was able to 
  integrate it with my data analysis with the help of my mentor. I compared the results and updated them to the group research paper in Overleaf. I will 
  do even more tests with this model to understand its capabiities and limitations.

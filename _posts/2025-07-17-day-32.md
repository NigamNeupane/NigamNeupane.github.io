title: "Day 32 â€“ Applying ML codes in MATLAB"

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued adjusting, improving and running the custom ELM model by applying different methods. I updated my results and achievements in 
  overleaf. Today, I began working the ML codes in a programming software called MATLAB. It is very similar to python, so it was not difficult convert 
  the codes from python to MATLAB. I got similar results from MATLAB as I did in python which shows that the codes are working correctly even in different 
  platforms. I have almost completed the codng in MATLAB and now I will need to update the results in Overleaf using tables and graphs.
  
blockers: |
  It was initially difficult implementing the specific codes from Python to MATLAB. I had to search the syntaxes in web.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in further iplementing the codes and comparing the results for all the ML models in MATLAB. The custom ELM still performed 
  better than other models which shows that it is not only compatable in Python, it can be run in other programing languages. I will continue the coding 
  in MATLAB and update my results as I go.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continue adjusting, improving and running the custom ELM model by applying different methods. I updated my results and achievements in 
  overleaf. I managed to have the model get higher accuracy and fewer errors by changing things in the ELM library. I continued updating the results 
  for all the methods and models in the project report in overleaf. Today, I specifically focused on unbalanced data with cross-validation and the results 
  showed that balanced data still performs better. This comparision helps find the best techniques for machine learning and data analysis.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems with using cross-validation to train and test my ELM model. I couldn't get favorable results using that data.
  
reflection: |
  Today, I continued with training and testing the ML model which helped me understand it further and revise everything I learned while working with 
  other models. The results and comparision between models was very valuable in understanding machine learning further and also how to improve the 
  custom ELM further by implying similar features from other models.

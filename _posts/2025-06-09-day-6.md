what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned to use MATLAB (Mathematics Laboratory) software. I watched some YouTube videos and used various functions and syntax to build and run programs in MATLAB. The programming language was very similar to Python so it wasn't a difficult work to follow along with coding. I learned about basic functions like if, else statements, for loop, defining functions, input statement and disp statement. I also learned to work with matrices in MATLAB. The MATLAB software has more features than Jupyter notebook and is as easy to use. This program is specifically made to work with mathematical data so it will be very useful in the future project.
  
blockers: |
  There weren't any problems with coding today because I only revised the basics. The only slight problem was with different syntax from python programming.
  
reflection: |
  Today's session was very fruitful in learning to use a new programming language. I learned and revised various functions in the program and implemented in the MATLAB software. Hopefully, I will soon be able to start working on the actual assigned project.

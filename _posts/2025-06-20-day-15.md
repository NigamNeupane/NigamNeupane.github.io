what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked with KNN, ELM and SVM to train and test my algorithm by using different approaches. I was able to find out the MSE, RMSE and MAE of 
  the test and train values of the algorithm. I used percentage difference to compare the results of training and testing data. I also calculated the 
  accuracy of each methods. I found KNN to be more accurate than the other two approaches. I also learned about Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and 
  Convolutional Neural Network(CNN). They are used for data analysis in the algorithm.
  
blockers: |
  The blocker I faced was with learning about PCA and CNN.
  
reflection: |
  I learned and revised more with ELM, SVM and KNN today and used them for accurate data analysis. I was able to get good accuracy for both my training 
  and testing data on all the different approaches. I will need to learn more on the blockers I faced today so that I can use it in future projects.

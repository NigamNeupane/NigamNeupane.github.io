what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned to use R programming software and SPSS software. I revised and learned the basics in R by watching videos of it. R seemed very similar to Python and MATLAB, so it was quite easy to work with. I revised basic functions and syntax in R and then proceeded to work with data. The dataset was a collection of movies and show worldwide and the R software made it very easy for data analysis. I was able to work with tables and used it to practice analyzing and cleaning data from the given dataset. The SPSS software was fun to work with. I was able to make impressive graphs and charts using the software. I worked with a large collection of sample data to analyze data and build graphs. SPSS is a very useful tool to analyze data from dataset in graphics form. Both R and SPSS are very useful mathematics tools.

  The problem I faced initially was with running the SPSS program. It's not a free software so I had to connect my morgan email to the browser to use th software.
  
reflection: |
  Today's session was a interesting one. I got to learn and use various programs that are very useful in analyzing and working with data, especially those that have a huge amount of data. Both R and SPSS are robust and useful data analysis programs and it was fun to learn about them and work with them.

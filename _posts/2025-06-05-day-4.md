what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about preparing and working with numeric data and working with dates in a dataset. Numeric values in a dataset are variable and difficult to use because of the big difference of numeric values. I used various mathematical operations related to statisctis to organize and prepare the data for a suitable use. I used the mean of the data to reduce variability and used .std() syntax to find the standard deviation to further reduce data variability. This was a very effective method to make data more readable and usable within the program. I learned about working with skewed data and the methods to fix them. I used histographs to find the common values and referenced those values to adjust my data. I learned about dealing with dates in the dataset. I used the pd.to_datetime() syntax to convert various types of input into datetime objects. I worked with a sample dataset to manage the dates within them to a common format. I was able to rewrite odd date into the required date format.

blockers: |
  The problem I faced during today's session was with histogram. I was initially unable to retrieve histogram charts and graphs to assist with my data preparation.

reflection: |
  I learned some new things in today's session as well as revisited what I had learned in previous sessions. I understood how to work with numeric data in datasets and to prepare them to use properly in future data analysis projects. Knowledge of mathematics and statistics is very helpful while working with numeric data. I will take some time with analyzing histograms to properly search for any required data. This data analysis methos will be very useful in future projects.

what_i_learned: |
  Today, I began working in a new sub-project where I needed to build models for early detection of kidney diseases. I used the models ELM, KNN, 
  SVC, decision tree and random forest for the data analysis and disease prediction. I used both unbalanced and balanced datasets for the data analysis 
  to compare the results. I used SMOTE to balance the dataset to use it for disease prediction. I good good accuracy with my models. Accuracy varied 
  from 85% to 97% for my models.
  
blockers: |
  I faced the problem of overfitting with ELM, KNN and decision tree. This made my results wrong for my models.
  
reflection: |
  I learned and revised a lot today and implemented everything I learned for the past few weeks. I got accurate results from my models and I was able 
  to fix any problems I faced while running my program. I will need to fix the problem of overfitting to get even higher accuracy.

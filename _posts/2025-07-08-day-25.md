what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continue adjusting, improving and running the custom ELM model by applying different methods. I updated my results and achievements in 
  overleaf. I managed to have the model get higher accuracy and fewer errors by changing things in the ELM library. I also got the model to get 80%
  accuracy on identifying and working with unknown data. We will need more advanced form of our custom ELM for even higher accuracy and versatility 
  for different medical data. 
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems with using cross-validation to train and test my ELM model.
  
reflection: |
  Today, I continued with training and testing the ML model which helped me understand it further and revise everything I learned while working with 
  other models. I will soon use the more advanced custom ELM model which will give me even more knowledge about machine learning and data analysis.

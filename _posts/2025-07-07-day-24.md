what_i_learned: |
  Today, I ran our custom ELM with both balanced and unbalanced data. I also used cross-validation with the balanced data and compared the results 
  with the other methods. I used SMOTE to balance the data for data analysis. I achieved above 90% accuracy on both testing and training for all 
  methods while using the custom ELM. I adjusted various aspects of the ELM class using sigmoid, relu and tanh to get different results with my 
  ELM. I got slightly better results by changing things with the library itself.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems with using cross-validation to train and test my ELM model.

  Today was a unique experience

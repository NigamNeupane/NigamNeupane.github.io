what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued running my codes and trained and tested my models by applying new methods to increase accuracy and reduce errors. I addressed 
  the previous problem of overfitting by properly cleaning and balancing my dataset. I plotted new graphs and histogram of various columns in the 
  dataset and the results I got from my models. I uploaded the graphs in my overleaf project update, as well as the group presentation.
  
blockers: |
  I am facing some difficulty with the graphs and charts in my program. It's still unclear which subsets and clusters from my data I need to implement 
  in the graph.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in fixing my code and getting better results by applying various different methods. I revised testing and training ML 
  models, especially ELM, which will be very helpful in the final project. I will need to ask advice with my mentors about what data I will need to 
  use in the graphs in the report.

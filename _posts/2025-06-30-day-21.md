what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued training and testing my ML models in the kidney disease dataset. I trained a custom ELM with the data and got 90% accuracy while 
  testing. I fixed the problem of lower accuracy and overfitting in my other models by modifyng the code and further cleaning and balancing the dataset. 
  I made the necessary graphs for further data analysis using python. I also updated my progress in the student project report group file in overleaf.
  
blockers: |
  I am facing some difficulty with the graphs and charts in my program. It's still unclear which subsets and clusters from my data I need to implement 
  in the graph.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in fixing my code and getting better results by applying various different methods. I revised testing and training ML 
  models, especially ELM, which will be very helpful in the final project. I will need to ask advice with my mentors about what data I will need to 
  use in the graphs in the report.

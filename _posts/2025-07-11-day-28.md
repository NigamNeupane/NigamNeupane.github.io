what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continue adjusting, improving and running the custom ELM model by applying different methods. I updated my results and achievements in 
  overleaf. I managed to have the model get higher accuracy and fewer errors by changing things in the ELM library. In all the various training and 
  testing methods, the custom ELM still outperforms the traditional methods on the basis of high accuracy and less errors. In all the results, the ELM 
  models consistently get above 90% accuracy and error percentage less than 5% and in some cases error is even less than 2%.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems with using cross-validation to train and test my ELM model. I couldn't get favorable results using that data.
  
reflection: |
  Today, I continued with training and testing the ML model which helped me understand it further and revise everything I learned while working with 
  other models. The results and comparision between models was very valuable in understanding machine learning further and also how to improve the 
  custom ELM further by implying similar features from other models.

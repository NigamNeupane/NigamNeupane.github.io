what_i_learned: |
  Today, I continued running my codes and trained and tested my models by applying new methods to increase accuracy and reduce errors. I addressed 
  the previous problem of overfitting by properly cleaning and balancing my dataset. I plotted new graphs and histogram of various columns in the 
  dataset and the results I got from my models. I uploaded the graphs in my overleaf project update, as well as the group presentation. We completed 
  the presentation and we practiced presenting the slides.
  
blockers: |
  I am facing some difficulty with the presentation. I am taking too long to present my slides.
  
reflection: |
  Today, my group and I were able to complete our presentation slides as well as the demo video and then practiced presenting in front of our mentors. 
  We are still taking longer than we need to for the presentation but we will be able to manage the time with more practice.

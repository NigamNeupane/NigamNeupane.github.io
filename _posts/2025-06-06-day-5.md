what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned about merging data, frequency table and plotting graphs and charts with pandas. I was able to merge 2 or more tables into a bigger 
  table using pandas and analyze data within it. I was able to control which tables were primary and secondary to easily combine them. I was able to 
  use the frequency table to analyze specific data in the table and use the crosstab syntax to do it. I used pandas to plot my data in graphs and 
  charts. I used bar graph, scatterplot, box plot and also merged the graphs to analyze them collectively. Today, we did a group presentation on what 
  we accomplished this week, problems we faced, and plans for future weeks. I also presented my accomplishments for this week to my mentors.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some challenges while working with new syntax and functions in python. Working with frequency table was somewhat difficult to understand 
  initially. Using crosstab was challenging.
  
reflection: |
  I was able to revise everything I was able to learn this week by presenting it to my peers and mentors. I learned many new functions and syntax 
  this week. Some were difficult to understand but I was able to understand the difficult concepts by revising them. With the knowledge and practice 
  I got this week, I will be able to effectively work on my project next week.

what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned about various topics related to AI and machine learning. I learned about ajentic AI, which are designed to operate automatically without constant human intervention. I also learned about dependent and independent variables and the cause-and-effect relationship. Independent variables can be changed or manipulated by the researcher and it's the cause in the relationship. Dependent variables are measured or observed to see how they respond to changes in the independent variable and it's the effect in the relationship. Correlation and causation was also discussed with various database. Correlation is the relationship between two or more variables where their values tend to change together. Causation is the cause-and-effect relationship between two events or variables. Datasets can be in correlation but not necessarily in causation.

  I learned about the Anaconda software for programming. The software was difficult to use and understand as I have only used VS code for python programming.

reflection: |
  My first day in the in-person research camp was very fun and informational. We also did a enjoyable group project where we had to balance marshmallow on a tower of spaghetti sticks. I hope to do more interesting group projects in future sessions.

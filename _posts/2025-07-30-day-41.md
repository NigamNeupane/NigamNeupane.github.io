what_i_learned: |
  Today, I worked with my group to design and update the slides for the final presentation. We divided work and started writing about our project, our 
  accomplishments and the challenges we faced. We will work on our demo video soon. I continued updating the project overleaf as well. I included more 
  results and graphs by training and testing the models on both balanced data without cross-validation and balanced data with cross-validation. We completed the demo video for the final presentation as well as rehearsed for the presentation tomorrow. We also completed the research paper for our project in overleaf.
  
blockers: |
  I faced some problems understanding the new codes. Especially the functions defined in its internal codes.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day in learning about a new ML model and how to implement it. The codes were very difficult to understand but I was able to 
  integrate it with my data analysis with the help of my mentor. I compared the results and updated them to the group research paper in Overleaf. We did well during the presentation rehersal and completed it on time. We will practice more individually so that we can present our parts well in tomorrow's presentation.

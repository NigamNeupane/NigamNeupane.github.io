what_i_learned: |
  I learned about the various tools used in the Python software for programming. I learned about directory, which is a collection of key-value pairs; sets, which are unordered collection of unique items; lists, which are ordered collections of items that can contain mixed datatypes and are mutable(can be changed once written); and tuples, which are similar to lists but are immutable. I learned about single dimensional data structures(data is arranged in straight line) and multi dimensional data structures(data is arranged in tabular form). I learned about reading and writing CSV(Comma Separated Values) files. Syntax pd.read_csv() is used to read CSV files and .to_csv() is used to write CSV files. I also learned by Control Flow, which are: if, else, for and while statements. If and else statements check for conditions and initiate a command. For loop runs a program for a fixed number of times. While loop is also used to run a program multiple times but is used when the number of times to run it isn't specified.

blockers: |
  I faced some difficulties while learning about python today. numpy was a new term for me so i didn't understand it initially. Another problem I faced was with Pandas tool to read and write data between various data structures and file formats.

reflection: |
  I learned a lot in today's session. I revised topics I already knew about as well as topics I didn't know. I will revise what I have learned so that it will be easier for me to grasp even more difficult topics. I need to study more on the topics like numpy and Pandas as they will be used more in future assignments.

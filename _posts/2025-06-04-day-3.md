what_i_learned: |
  I worked with functions, list comprehension and data exploration and cleaning. I learned about defining functions, arguments and parameters used in the function syntax. I learned to work with functions with unknown number of arguments. I learned about lambda functions, unnamed functions that can be quickly used within the code in a single line. I then learned about list comprehension where codes are used to populate lists. For example, using for loop to fill a list with positive numbers from 0 to 100. I learned about nested list, list within a list, and also used nested list while working with string values. I used the zip() function to populate dictionary. I learned data exploration and cleaning with a sample dataset. I worked with functions like pd.Categorical() to categorize various data in the dataset. This is a very useful tool to properly organize data and retrieve required information quickly from the dataset. I used .describe(), .head(), .unique(), etc. functions for data analysis in today's session.


blockers: |
  The problem I faced initially was while working with datasets. The pd.Categorical() syntax was especially difficult to understand first. I didn't know where the category was being built and what data they consisted.

reflection: |
  Working with functions was the easiest task today. I was able to define functions and use them in my codes. Populating lists and dictionary by using for loop and specific functions was also quite easy as I had experience working with them in previous sessions. I was able to revise and understand their purpose quickly. I had worked with numpy, pandas and datasets before but I am still having some difficulty integrating them independently. I will need more practice with them. Learning new syntax while working with datasets was initially difficult to grasp but I understood them after some practice. I will need more practice before I am ready to participate in larger group projects with bigger datasets.

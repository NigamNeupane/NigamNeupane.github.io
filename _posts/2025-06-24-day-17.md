what_i_learned: |
  Today, I read a research paper and implemented the code with the dataset provided to build an algorithm to work with the dataset. My research paper 
  was about secure transaction and fraud detection with credit cards. I implemented Multilayer Perception(MPL), KNN, random foresst and decision tree 
  to build 4 different algorithms to test and train with the data. The research paper provided the required dataset and clear instructions to use it 
  in the code. The dataset was already clean and usable and I was able to get 99% accuracy on both testing and training on all four methods. The dataset 
  consisted of almost 300,000 records, so I was able to get good accuracy for my algorithm.
  
blockers: |
  The blocker I faced was with new and complex terms like recall value, F-1 score and cross-validation.
  
reflection: |
  I made good progress today while learning to work with different machine learning methods like MLP, KNN, Random forest and decision tree. The objective 
  of our original project is to customize a Extreme Machine Learning(ELM) algorithm to allow it to train with any medical data. The experience 
  working with various other machine algorithm will be valuable in making such custom algorithm in the future project.

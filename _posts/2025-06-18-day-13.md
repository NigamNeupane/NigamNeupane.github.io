what_i_learned: |
  Today, I read some research papers related to my project goals. I also revised working with SPSS, R and Python for data analysis and algorithm 
  training and testing. I worked with some sample data and used it to train and test a sample algorithm with Support Vector Algorithm(SVM). I went through some research papers so that I can practice data collection for the future project. I learned about the analysis of various medical data 
  of patients by using graphs, charts and histogram.
  
blockers: |
  The blocker I faced was to learn about extreme machine learning and support vector algorithm.
  
reflection: |
  Today's session was a bit more difficult than previous ones. The concept of ELM, SVM and KNN were new to me, so I couldn't implement them well in 
  my codes. I will need to practice more in these methods to train and test my algorithm in future sessions.

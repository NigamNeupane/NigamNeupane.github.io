what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned to use machine learning for data analysis. I used various python codes to train and test the algorithm with the provided data. I used Extreme Learning 
  Machine(ELM), Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Random Forest Machine Learning. All these methods and software are used in 
  python programming to train and test the algorithm with the provided dataset. We also use histograms and scatterplots to check the accuracy of the 
  data analysis done by our algorithm. We also use graphs and charts for error comparison and correction. I was able to get 93% accuracy in my data 
  analysis with a test algorithm.
  
blockers: |
  The only blocker I faced today was with the overwhelming number of codes used to train the algorithm.
  
reflection: |
  I learned a lot in today's session. I was able to train and test various test algorithms with close enough accuracy. I learned about various methods 
  used for data analysis in python. This knowledge will be helpful in creating and training the algorithm for our project in the future.
